# 26 June - 10 July 2023
- Main goal is to just build some sort of traction
- Commit some code & infra setup
- Get started on Authentication

# Planning & questions

- what spotify [auth methods](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization) are appropriate here?
- unit test environment might be the best way to build this out, like Michael did in the videos
- vite + vitest
- find some effect example repo's

## Some examples of the desired API

- spotifyClient.track.details()
- spotifyClient.user.details()
- spotifyClient.user.topItems()
