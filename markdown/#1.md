# 26 June - 10 July 2023
- Main goal is to just build some sort of traction.
- A large portion of the work this cycle may be [shaping](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.1-chapter-02#two-tracks), or relating to.
- Commit some code & infra setup
- Get started on Authentication

# Planning & questions

- what spotify [auth methods](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/authorization) are appropriate here?
- unit test environment might be the best way to build this out, like Michael did in the videos
- vite + vitest
- find some effect example repo's

 ## What's being built
- [spotify-web-api-ts](https://github.com/adamgrieger/spotify-web-api-ts), but written using [Effect-ts](https://www.effect.website/)
- Intended for server & browser

## Some examples of the desired API

- spotifyClient.track.details()
- spotifyClient.user.details()
- spotifyClient.user.topItems()

# Tue June 27
- Checking out [spotify web scripts](https://github.com/spotify/web-scripts). Is this a dependency I want to introduce?
 Likely no, as it'll abstract away control I want to have.

# Next session
- [x] CI: run tests on each commit
- [ ] Basic http request structure
