# Context 

My workflow on projects borrows heavily from [37signals' Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) process.
- [Kickoff](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.3-chapter-09#post-the-kick-off-message) is part of it, 
the idea is to let your stakeholders what you'll be working on for the next cycle.
Read more about it [here](https://rmakara.github.io/Shape-Up-How-to-do-a-Project-Kickoff).

## Process
- I'll be following 2 week cycles to start off. Retro & Planning will be done at once
- 1 - 2 week [cooldown](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/2.2-chapter-08#cool-down) every 6 weeks.

## Intentions
- I'm looking at this as a long term project to polish up on a bunch of topics of interest.
- A few examples:
  - TDD: The projects I've been in haven't been heavy on tests. I need a playground to practice in
  - Publishing an npm package: I want to learn how to do this effectitely, with minimal cognitive overhead. I intend on using this http-client in my own apps.
  - Typescript
